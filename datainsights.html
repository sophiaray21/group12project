            <p>
                We were able to gather a ton of data regarding sound metrics, artis data, ad album data
                about each of our Billboard Hits and here, visually, are some takeaways and trends we 
                noticed when we were looking at the data. Through our analysis, weâ€™ve found how musical 
                trends have evolved over the years, with shifts in genre popularity, the rise of new artists, 
                and how listeners' tastes influence the music industry. Check out the visualizations above 
                for a deep dive into the insights!

                The image displays a series of scatter plots that examine the relationship between track popularity 
                and various audio features, including danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, 
                liveness, valence, and tempo. In each plot, the x-axis represents one of these features, while the y-axis 
                tracks the popularity of each song, with values ranging from 0 to 100. These plots help identify any potential 
                correlations or trends between the features and a track's popularity.

                Upon reviewing the plots, we can see some interesting trends. The danceability vs. popularity plot suggests a 
                slight positive correlation, with more danceable tracks tending to be somewhat more popular. However, the relationship 
                appears weak, as the data points are scattered. Similarly, energy vs. popularity shows a moderate positive trend, where
                 tracks with higher energy levels seem to have a slightly better chance at achieving higher popularity, although the 
                 correlation is not very strong. In the case of speechiness vs. popularity, the plot reveals a mild positive relationship, 
                 indicating that tracks with more speech elements might be more popular, but the trend is not highly pronounced. The 
                 acousticness vs. popularity plot shows a weak negative correlation, with more acoustic tracks generally exhibiting lower 
                 popularity scores, suggesting that non-acoustic tracks are more likely to perform better.

                The scatter plot for instrumentalness vs. popularity also demonstrates a weak negative correlation, with instrumental tracks 
                usually having lower popularity. This suggests that vocal tracks are more popular than instrumental ones. Similarly, the
                 liveness vs. popularity plot points to a slightly negative relationship, with tracks that have a live sound tending to be 
                 less popular. The valence vs. popularity plot suggests a weak negative correlation, where more positive or happier tracks 
                 tend to have lower popularity, indicating that melancholic or darker tracks might be favored. Lastly, the tempo vs. 
                 popularity plot shows a very weak negative trend, suggesting that faster-paced songs do not necessarily perform better in 
                 terms of popularity.

                The box plot visualizes the distribution of track popularity across different genre groups, 
                with each box representing the most prominent genres. The height of the box shows the interquartile range (IQR) 
                of popularity scores, while the horizontal line inside the box indicates the median popularity. 
                The "whiskers" extending from the box represent the range of values, and any points outside the 
                whiskers are considered outliers. The plot effectively highlights the spread and tendencies
                of track popularity for each genre group.

                In terms of specific genres, Motown shows a wide distribution with its median track popularity 
                around 40, indicating a mixture of low and high popularity tracks within this genre. This makes 
                sense given that the data includes tracks from years long ago where Motown was very popular whereas now 
                not so much. Rock-and-roll shares a similar distribution with a median around 40, though its box is slightly smaller than that 
                of Motown, suggesting less variation in popularity. This genre has stood the test of time moreso than Motown. British Invasion and Pop genres have higher median 
                popularity, around 50 and 60 respectively, indicating more popular tracks within these genres. Country 
                and Rap genres have a more concentrated distribution, with their popularity centering around the lower 
                50s to 60s, though Rap shows a few outliers with higher popularity scores. This comparison reveals how 
                popularity varies across genre groups, with some genres tending to have more popular tracks on average 
                than others.

                This heatmap displays the correlation between various Spotify audio features and track popularity 
                (labeled as "track_pop"). The correlations range from -1 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a 
                strong positive relationship, values closer to -1 indicate a strong negative relationship, and values 
                near 0 suggest little to no correlation. The color gradient visualizes these correlations, with red 
                representing positive correlations, blue representing negative correlations, and lighter shades indicating 
                weaker relationships.

                From the heatmap, valence (a measure of musical positivity) exhibits the strongest positive correlation with track popularity 
                (0.41), suggesting that songs with happier or more uplifting tones tend to be more popular. Danceability (0.16), energy (0.15),
                 and speechiness (0.15) also show mild positive correlations, indicating that tracks with these characteristics slightly tend 
                 to resonate better with listeners.

                On the other hand, acousticness (-0.26) has the most notable negative correlation with popularity, implying that highly 
                acoustic songs are less likely to achieve widespread popularity. Similarly, instrumentalness (-0.10) shows a weak negative 
                correlation, meaning tracks that are purely instrumental are slightly less likely to be popular. Other features, such as 
                liveness (-0.05) and tempo (-0.01), show negligible or no meaningful relationship with track popularity.

                In summary, the heatmap highlights that energetic, danceable, and emotionally positive songs are generally more popular, 
                while highly acoustic or instrumental tracks are less so. However, the correlations are relatively modest, suggesting that
                while audio features influence popularity, other factors like artist recognition, marketing, and cultural trends also play 
                significant roles.

                This plot shows the density of songs across different genre groups over time, spanning from the 1950s to the 
                2020s. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis shows the number of songs released per genre group 
                in each year. Different genre groups are represented by distinct colored lines: motown (blue), rock-and-roll 
                (orange), pop (green), british invasion (purple), country (brown), and rap (red).

From the graph, we can observe several key trends. Rock-and-roll and pop genres dominate in the mid-20th century, with a 
significant surge in popularity for rock-and-roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s, peaking in the 1970s. Pop music also 
shows a noticeable increase in the 1980s, continuing to rise steadily into the 2000s and 2010s. On the other hand, motown 
music shows more moderate growth, with its peak occurring in the 1960s, before declining sharply in the 1970s and remaining 
relatively low afterward.

The british invasion genre sees its highest points in the 1960s, aligning with the era of British bands' like The Beatles, 
while country music maintains a steady, low but consistent presence throughout the decades, with a slight uptick in the 2000s. 
Rap music, however, shows a dramatic rise starting in the 1980s and exploding in popularity in the 2000s and 2010s, surpassing
 many of the other genre groups. Note here that rap music's trajectory contrasts with that of the other genres, indicating its substantial 
 and relatively recent impact on the music industry.

Overall, the graph illustrates landscape of music genres, with rock-and-roll and pop dominating the earlier decades,
 followed by the rise of rap in more recent years. This shift highlights the changing tastes and cultural influences over the 
 decades, with certain genres like rock-and-roll and motown reaching their peak during specific cultural moments, while others 
 like pop and rap have sustained long-term growth and remained '#1'.

                This interactive plot explores some of the top tracks over the years and their popularities 
                with data based on their genres. Hover datsa here shows us the track name, genre, peak popularity 
                on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and is colored by a genre grouping. Since there are so many genres that 
                Spotify lists and qualifiesa it was hard to nail down a color mapping that made sense here hence why we 
                see the category null in the lengend. Check out the interactivity by hovering and moving your mouse over 
                this visualization.
