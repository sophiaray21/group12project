            <p>
                For this project, we’re using a playlist created by a music enthusiast who compiled every 
                Billboard Top 100 song from 1950 to 2023 into a single playlist. This collection offers a 
                comprehensive view of the most popular songs spanning over seven decades, capturing over 
                6,500 songs! By analyzing this playlist with Spotify’s API, we are able to extract key features 
                such as danceability, tempo, rhythm, melodic quality, and genre, providing insights into 
                how music has transformed across time and measures up to recent popular songs. This dataset
                 serves as the foundation for our exploration of taste changes over time. 

            </p>

            <p>
                We read our data into python using Spotify’s API using a unique secret and Client ID 
                and had to iterate over the playlist multiple times to be able to extract the data 
                we need due to Spotify API’s limitation of 100 songs per API Call. This data extraction 
                might take some time as we work with the limitations of this specific API. From there, we 
                have worked our data down to reduce certain attributes that might be irrelevant such as 
                song ID numbers specific to Spotify’s platform as we want this model to be as universal 
                as possible. 

            </p>
